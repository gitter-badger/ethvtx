Once the store is created, `ethvtx` is ready to be started, it just needs your signal !

## Setting Web3

The first thing you should do is set the `web3` instance of your choice inside the store. In most of the cases, you want to recover it from your browser. These are the steps to properly load `web3` inside `ethvtx`.

First you will need to install `web3@1.0.0-beta.32`. This is currently the most stable version tested with `ethvtx`. We will try to update this version as soon as `web3` releases new versions that work consistently with our mechanisms.

```jsx

// Import your web3@1.0.0-beta.32
import * as Web3 from 'web3';
import { setWeb3 } from 'ethvtx/lib/dispatchers';

// You should of course check if it exists to detect if the user has a wallet provider.
const window_web3 = window.web3;

// Build an instance of web3@1.0.0-beta.32 by using the provider from the window instance
// Very useful when you want to use a different version of web3 than the one exposed by the wallet provider (Metamask)
const web3 = new Web3(window_web3.currentProvider);

setWeb3(store.dispatch, web3);

```

## Setting Initial Smart Contracts

Setting up initial smart contracts should happen between setting the web3 instance and calling the start method.

### Manual

Let's pretend you have a `SimpleStorage' contract, and you deployed two instances of it. If you wanted to load it you would do this.

```jsx

import { loadContractSpec, loadContractInstance } from 'ethvtx/lib/dispatchers';

const contract_name = 'SimpleStorage';
const contract_one_address = '0x6C90AeCe04198DA2d5CA9B956b8F95aF8041DE37';
const contract_two_address = '0x09A38F24D34fa76CFe79725AE62ABb0906571634';
const contract_abi = // Load your contract abi.
const contract_runtime_bytecode = // Load your contract runtime bytecode

// ######
//   ##   
//   ##   
//   ##   
// ######    Load your contract specifications

loadContractSpec(store.dispatch, contract_name, contract_abi, {
    bin: contract_runtime_bytecode, // This is optional.
    permanent: true // By default false.
});

// If bin is provided, the store will check on the network if it 
// finds the same bytecode at the specified address. 
// Useful to find out if a user is not of the good network

// If permanent is true, the store will keep the spec 
// even after a reset of the store. The store resets itself 
// when the user changes its coinbase or its network, 
// or can be manually triggered

// #########
//   ## ##   
//   ## ##   
//   ## ##   
// #########    Load your contract instances

loadContractInstance(store.dispatch, contract_name, contract_one_address, {
    permanent: true // By default false
});

loadContractInstance(store.dispatch, contract_name, contract_two_address, {
    permanent: true // By default false,
    alias: '@defaultsimplestorage' // This is optional
});

// If alias is provided, you will be able to reference this contract with it
// on most of the other helper functions and tools.

// If permanent is true, same as the specs, the store will keep it even after a reset.

```

## Starting everything up !

`ethvtx` is now ready. Let's sum things up.

To start `ethvtx` you need:

* to recover reducers, initial state and sagas
* to add your reducers, initial state and sagas if you have any
* to create the redux store as shown in the store creation section
* to initialize the contract engine with the store
* to set the web3 instance
* to load the smart contracts

And now you can finally call the start function to boot things up !

```jsx

import { start } from 'ethvtx/lib/dispatchers';

// Before being able to use a wallet provider, you now need to require access.
// A function is exposed on the window if the access request is required.
// This function must be called before being able to use the wallet provider.

const enable = window.ethereum ? window.ethereum.enable : undefined;

start(store.dispatch, enable);

// The start function will give this callback to the store, which will ensure
// it is properly called. If it's undefined, the store will simply ignore it.

```

The store is now started, and the next thing you want to do is recover its status !
